For NFTs:

Factory Contract Template:
https://github.com/Vara-Lab/Smart-Contract-Fabricator-Template/tree/main

ToDo:
[X] 1. Verify NFT Contract in /backend
[X] 2. Verify Init() in Factory for NFT instead of FT
[] 3. Delete unnecesary fields where applies.
[] 4. Verify IO dependencies before push into main
[] 4.1. Consolidate dependencies of Cargo.toml files in Factory and NFT
[] 5. Personalize Both Factory and UVENFTS to adapt to UVE Platform



CLI:
cargo build --release for quicker compilation after modifications to repo
Note: Delete \target folder after it compiles succesfully to avoid residual/trash files
